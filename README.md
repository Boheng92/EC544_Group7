# Group7
Since challenge 1 and 2 are working on the same device, all the contents are stored in the same file, which used to named challenge 1 and has recently been renamed to challenge 2. So if you are looking for our code of challenge 1, you can look into the challenge 2 folder and all the codes can be found there. And you can go through the historical commits of challenge two or by just looking into another github repository which we used for challenge 1: https://github.com/nirmit2810/Team7.git for the previous version of codes for challenge 1.
