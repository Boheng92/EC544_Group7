# Group7
Since challenge 1 and 2 are working on the same device, all the contents are stored in the same file, which used to named challenge 1 and has recently been renamed to challenge 1&2. So if you are looking for our code of challenge 1, you can look into the challenge 1&2 folder and all the codes can be found there. And you can go through the historical commits of challenge 1&2 or by just looking into another github repository which we used for challenge 1: https://github.com/nirmit2810/Team7.git for the previous version of codes for challenge 1. 

Sorry for the trouble, we will seperate each challenge apart in the future.
